    <h1>Cambodian Beef Stew</h1>
    <img src="../img/beefstew.jpg" alt="beef stew" width="400">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cambodian kor ko (beef stew) is similar to the Vietnamese bo kho but with a few differences. It is packed with tender chunks of beef braised in a delicious broth and loaded with an assortment of herbs and aromatics. It is commonly served with rice noodles (my personal favorite) or bread. Sometimes I will order it with both though, and I love it as a breakfast dish.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the meat. Add beef to a large pot and add 1 tbsp salt and enough tap water to barely cover the meat. Bring to a boil on high heat, and once it hits a boil for 30 seconds, kill the heat, drain, and rinse under running water to clean. If you haven't cut the meat into 3/4 â€“ 1" pieces yet, do it now.</li>
        <li>Marinate the meat. Add all marinade ingredients to the meat in a covered bowl or a bag for at least two hours, but overnight would be better.</li>
        <li>Aromatics. Preheat a large pot on medium high. When hot, add the oil, let it warm a bit, then add all the garlic and stir to slowly saute until it turns light brown. Then add the paprika an stir until it releases its aroma, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Broth. Add all broth ingredients to the pot except the carrots. Turn the heat to high until it hits a boil, then reduce heat so it maintains a low boil. Cook until the meat is as tender as you'd like it, about 60-90 minutes. Add carrots towards the final 10 minutes so it softens. Discard the cooked onions and star anise pods.</li>
        <li>Boil rice noodles in a seprate pot or serve with bread. Serve with fresh basil, lime, cilantro, and raw onions if you wish.</li>
    </ol>
